Remove redundany of code

--MEDIUM--
Figure out what to make boons do
Work on a proper debugging system
Determine wave/boss compositions

	Bombs

Enemies- shoot different types of projectiles/lasers/whatever
	(normal) - easy kill, average movement speed, slow firing speed
	(fast) -  weakest armor, highest movement speed, high firing speed, comes in large waves
	(tank) - high armor, low movement speed, medium-high firing speed, comes in small groups
	(stationary) - ?
	(boss) - Multi-stage bosses? Mini-bosses? Final-bosses?
