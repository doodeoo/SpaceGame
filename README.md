## Further Ideas

Weapons aren't pre-set, but customizable? Complex weapon customization?
AI controlled teammates rather than ones that just hang on wings?

MULTIPLAYER!!?

Pre-fab and procedurally generated waves of enemies

Visual hit indication on enemies (per hit) - flash, change in opacity

#### Collectables - 
- Resources dropped from enemies
- 1-ups
- Powerups temporarily activate weapon-dependant-awesomeness
- ...?

#### Bullets/Projectiles/Lasers/ThingsThatGoBoom - 
- Swarm Missiles
- Bombs
- ...?

#### Enemies- shoot different types of projectiles/lasers/whatever
- normal - easy kill, average movement speed, slow firing speed
- fast -  weakest armor, highest movement speed, high firing speed, comes in large waves
- tank - high armor, low movement speed, medium-high firing speed, comes in small groups
- stationary - ?
- boss - Multi-stage bosses? Mini-bosses? Final-bosses?

#### Game Modes-
